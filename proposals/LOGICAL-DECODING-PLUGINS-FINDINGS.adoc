= PostgreSQL Logical Decoding Plugins: Findings

Date: 2026-02-15

== Short Answer

Yes, there are other PostgreSQL logical decoding output plugins besides `wal2json`.

== What Is Officially in PostgreSQL

1. `pgoutput` (built-in standard plugin)
- PostgreSQL docs describe `pgoutput` as the standard plugin used by built-in logical replication.
- It is the default choice for publication/subscription style logical replication.

2. `test_decoding` (example/testing plugin)
- PostgreSQL docs describe `test_decoding` as an example output plugin, mainly useful as a reference and for testing.
- It outputs text-form decoded changes.

3. Custom output plugins are supported
- PostgreSQL exposes an output plugin API (`_PG_output_plugin_init`, callbacks) so additional plugins can be developed and loaded as shared libraries.

== Well-Known Third-Party PostgreSQL Output Plugins

1. `wal2json`
- JSON output plugin for logical decoding.
- Commonly used by CDC integrations that prefer JSON payloads.

2. `postgres-decoderbufs` / `decoderbufs`
- Protocol Buffers output plugin for logical decoding.
- `postgres-decoderbufs` is a maintained fork used in Debezium contexts.

3. Other community plugins exist
- The PostgreSQL wiki keeps a community-maintained catalog of additional plugins (JSON/SQL/Protobuf/etc.).
- This list is useful for discovery but is not an official support guarantee.

== Practical Conclusion for This Library

If this library should remain PostgreSQL-native and broadly deployable:

1. First-class support should include:
- `pgoutput` (built-in, no extra server plugin install)
- `wal2json` (already used)

2. Optional/advanced support can include:
- `postgres-decoderbufs` or other plugins via a generic decoder interface

3. API implication:
- Keep plugin name and plugin options configurable (`setPlugin`, `setPluginOptions`)
- Keep decoder pluggable so each plugin can map its payload format cleanly

== Notes

- Plugin availability is environment-dependent (managed cloud offerings may limit custom shared-library plugins).
- `pgoutput` generally has the least operational friction because it is built into PostgreSQL.
