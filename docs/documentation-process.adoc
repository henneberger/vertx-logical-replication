:toc: left

This document defines how we write and maintain documentation for the logical replication connector.

Our goal is to keep docs practical, accurate, and aligned with the style used in the main Vert.x manuals.

== Scope

Document all currently supported connectors:

* PostgreSQL
* SQL Server
* MySQL
* MariaDB
* CockroachDB
* Oracle
* Db2
* Cassandra
* ScyllaDB
* MongoDB
* Neo4j

== Style

Write in the Vert.x manual style:

* Use AsciiDoc.
* Use short sections with `==` and `===` headings.
* Explain behavior first, then show code.
* Keep tone direct and technical.
* Prefer operational guidance over marketing text.

== File layout

Use this structure:

* `docs/index.adoc` as the manual entry point
* `docs/postgresql.adoc` for PostgreSQL connector docs
* Keep supported-database matrix and caveats centralized in `docs/index.adoc`
* `docs/documentation-process.adoc` for contributor workflow

== Authoring workflow

1. Confirm behavior against current source code in the corresponding `replication-*` module.
2. Update the relevant chapter first, then update `docs/index.adoc` if navigation or flow changed.
3. Keep examples minimal and production-safe (`passwordEnv`, explicit preflight, explicit close).
4. Verify command snippets and configuration keys.
5. Run build/tests for touched modules when examples or defaults are changed.

== Review checklist

Before merging documentation changes, verify:

* Supported-database list reflects current parent `pom.xml` modules.
* API names and option names match current code.
* Preflight behavior is described correctly.
* Checkpoint and retry expectations are clear.
* `README.adoc` points to the updated docs.

== Release checklist

For each release candidate:

1. Re-validate setup prerequisites on fresh local environments.
2. Re-run integration tests for the connector modules touched by the docs update.
3. Update version snippets in docs.
4. Verify links render in repository viewers.
5. Confirm no user-facing docs were added for incomplete connectors.
