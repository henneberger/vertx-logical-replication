= Vert.x Logical Replication Connector Manual
:toc: left

At the heart of this project is a set of APIs for consuming database changes as reactive streams on top of Vert.x.

This manual uses PostgreSQL as the full walkthrough and lists all supported connectors and caveats on this page:

* PostgreSQL logical replication (`wal2json`)
* SQL Server CDC polling
* MySQL binlog CDC
* MariaDB CDC adapter (currently polling)
* CockroachDB CDC adapter (currently polling)
* Oracle CDC adapter (currently polling)
* Db2 CDC adapter (currently polling)
* Cassandra CDC adapter (DB-native)
* ScyllaDB CDC adapter (DB-native)
* MongoDB change stream adapter
* Neo4j CDC adapter (DB-native)

If you are using Maven, add the dependency for the connector you need:

* PostgreSQL:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.henneberger</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-pg-logical-replication</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* SQL Server:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.henneberger</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-sqlserver-cdc-replication</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

== In the beginning there is a replication stream

Each connector implements the same stream lifecycle:

* `preflight()` to validate source prerequisites
* `start()` to begin consuming changes
* `subscribe(...)` or `startAndSubscribe(...)` to receive events
* `close()` to stop

You can treat each connector as a database-specific implementation of the shared `ReplicationStream` contract.

== Recommended startup flow

Use this sequence in production:

1. Build options explicitly.
2. Run `preflight()` and fail fast on errors.
3. Use `startAndSubscribe(...)` for deterministic startup behavior.
4. Persist checkpoints (`LsnStore`) outside development environments.
5. Register state handlers and metrics listeners for observability.

== Checkpoint storage

`vertx-replication-core` includes several `LsnStore` implementations so you can choose storage based on environment:

* `NoopLsnStore` for local development only.
* `InMemoryLsnStore` for tests.
* `LocalMapLsnStore` for Vert.x process-local shared data.
* `FileLsnStore` for durable JSON-file persistence.
* `PrefixedLsnStore` to namespace keys over any existing store.

== Connector-specific caveats

Non-PostgreSQL connectors have database-specific setup differences. Minimum checks by connector:

* SQL Server: enable SQL Server Agent, `sp_cdc_enable_db`, and table-level CDC/capture instance.
* MySQL and MariaDB: enable binlog, use ROW format, and verify connector/auth compatibility.
* CockroachDB: verify CDC/changefeed permissions and sink/source compatibility used by the adapter.
* Oracle: verify required CDC/log mining prerequisites and connector principal privileges.
* Db2: verify CDC/change data capture setup and polling/query privileges.
* Cassandra and ScyllaDB: verify CDC is enabled at table/keyspace level and retention windows match consumer lag.
* MongoDB: run as replica set/sharded deployment with change streams enabled and proper read permissions.
* Neo4j: verify change data capture/event stream prerequisites and driver authentication/permissions.
